1. FP - more robustness (Machines should help people and not vice versa):
no null pointer, effect types with requirements for better testability

2. Simple static types with rememberable names (Vect, Struct)

3. Simple lib importing and versioning (importing at a single file)
also it's possible to somehow use dates instead (or with) the versions numbers
