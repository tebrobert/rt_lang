1. FP - more robustness (Machines should help people and not vice versa):
no null pointer, effect types with requirements for better testability

2. Simple static types with rememberable names (Vect, Struct)
and also implement anonymous structs for more compiler awareness

3. To take responsibility for numeric types and values
and make usage of values like inf and nan more clear

4. Simple lib importing and versioning (importing at a single file)
also it's possible to somehow use dates instead (or with) the versions numbers
